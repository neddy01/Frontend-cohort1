I regularly use websites and web applications such as Google Workspace, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Notion for productivity, learning, and professional networking. Among these, Notion stands out as a particularly well-designed web application. Its clean and minimal interface, intuitive navigation, and flexible layout make it highly effective from a user’s perspective. Notion’s drag-and-drop functionality, responsive design, and consistent use of whitespace provide a smooth and distraction-free experience. It allows users to organize complex information easily, demonstrating how thoughtful frontend design can make even powerful tools feel simple and accessible.

By the end of this cohort, I hope to build a fully functional and visually appealing portfolio website that showcases my projects, technical skills, and growth as a frontend developer. I also aim to gain the confidence to work on real-world web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating both design and functionality seamlessly.

I am most excited to learn about responsive design, interactive user interfaces, and how to connect frontend code with backend data. These areas will allow me to turn creative ideas into engaging user experiences. However, I am a bit nervous about mastering JavaScript frameworks and ensuring cross-browser compatibility, as they require deeper technical understanding and practice. Still, I’m motivated to embrace the challenge and grow through hands-on learning.
